Car Tracker - HTML5 Canvas
Welcome to the Car Game repository!

This project was initially created in 2021 during my first year of college.
This is a simple and fun car game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the help of the HTML5 Canvas element. In this game, you'll navigate your car through a series of oncoming enemy cars, trying to avoid collisions and achieve the highest score possible.

Please pardon the unconventional car designs â€“ they might resemble walking beds more than actual cars! ðŸ˜„ Future updates might bring more polished visuals, but for now, enjoy the quirky charm of the game.
